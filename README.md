## Highlights

- Code on any device with a consistent development environment
- Use cloud servers to speed up tests, compilations, downloads, and more
- Preserve battery life when you're on the go; all intensive tasks run on your server

## Getting Started

We offer an install script that automates most of the process. See [Installation](./docs/install.md#quick-install) for further details, as well as manual installation instructions for most use cases.
